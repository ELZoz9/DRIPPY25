# Backend Stubs for Drippy App

This backend prototype simulates key API endpoints needed for the final system:

### ✓ User Authentication
- Simulated login endpoint

### ✓ Product Management
- Fetch list of products
- Fetch product details

### ✓ Order Processing
- Simulated "place order" endpoint

### ✓ Dummy Data Source
- `products.json` acts as an in-memory database
- No real server is required at this stage

These stubs allow the Flutter frontend to continue development and testing while the real backend is under construction.
